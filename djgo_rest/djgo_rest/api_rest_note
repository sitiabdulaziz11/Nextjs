1️⃣ What exactly is an API in a web app?

Think of a web app in three layers:

Frontend (React/HTML/JS)  <--->  Backend (Django/Python)  <--->  Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)


The Database stores your data (students, results, users).

The Backend contains the logic (how to save, read, update, delete data).

The Frontend displays data and interacts with users.

API = the messenger between frontend and backend

It is NOT the database, and it is NOT Axios.
It is the interface (or endpoint) your frontend calls to get or send data.

Example:

Your React app wants a list of students.

It sends a request to your backend:

GET http://localhost:8000/api/students/


The backend receives the request, queries the database, and sends JSON data back.

Here, the API is the URL + the backend logic that handles the request.
So:

http://localhost:8000/api/students/ → the API endpoint

Django REST Framework helps you build this endpoint easily.

2️⃣ What is REST then?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of rules to design APIs:

Use HTTP methods to describe actions:

GET → read data

POST → create data

PUT/PATCH → update data

DELETE → delete data

Resources are accessed via URLs:

/api/students/ → all students

/api/students/1/ → student with ID 1

REST is a design style. The API is the actual endpoint you call.

3️⃣ Do you have to write “/api/” in URLs?

No ✨ — it is just a convention, not mandatory.

Many developers use /api/ to clearly separate API endpoints from normal web pages.

You could name your URL anything: /students/, /v1/students/, /users/ — it doesn’t matter as long as it’s consistent.

Example in urls.py:

from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from .views import StudentViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'students', StudentViewSet)
urlpatterns = router.urls


Here, /students/ is enough. Adding /api/ is just to make it clear:

/api/students/

4️⃣ Where does Axios fit in?

Axios is how the frontend talks to the API.

Example:

axios.get("http://localhost:8000/api/students/")
  .then(response => console.log(response.data));


Axios just sends the HTTP request; the API receives it and responds with JSON.

🔑 Visual analogy:
Frontend (React)   ---Axios--->   API (Django REST endpoint)   ---queries---> Database
      |                                     |
      |<---------JSON Response-------------|


Frontend: wants data

API (endpoint): gives data

Database: stores data

So API = the part in the backend that the frontend calls, and REST = how the API is designed.
